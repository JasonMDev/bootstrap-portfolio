# Bootstrap Portfolio

## Introduction
A demo portfolio built by leveraging best practises from the HTML5 Boilerplate along with Bootstrap.

This is based on the book [*Bootstrap Site Blueprints*](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/bootstrap-site-blueprints) written by David Cochran, Ian Whitley and published in Feb 2014. 

The general outline was followed, however the latest versions of the HTML5 boilerplate and bootstrap libraries at the time were incorporated.

## Feautures
These are some of the feautures that have been added to the web page (*text modified from above mentioned book*):
*   Set up a very solid markup structure provided by the HTML5 Boilerplate
*   Leveraged Bootstrap's responsive navbar, carousel, and grid system
*   Customized several of Bootstrap's LESS files
*   Created LESS files and folded them seamlessly into the project
*   Doubled available icons by folding Font Awesome into our workflow
*   Improved future maintenance of the site by implementing a thoughtful file organization scheme and leaving a trail of helpful commentsâ€”all without creating code bloat
